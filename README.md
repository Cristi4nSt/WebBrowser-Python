# Browser
![browse-screenshot](https://github.com/Cristi4nSt/WebBrowser-Python/blob/main/assets/browser/browserImage.png?raw=true)
I was inspired by Opera One to create the interface and colors


# Funcs
Currently there are basic functions of each browser (reload the page, return the page, view history, etc.)
The zoom is saved in the DataBase, so if the browser closes, it will open the page with the previously set zoom

# Requirements
- Python 3.12.0 or superior
- PyQt5
